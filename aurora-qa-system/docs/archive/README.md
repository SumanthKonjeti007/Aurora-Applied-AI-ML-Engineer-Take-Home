## Archived Files

### extract_all.py
- **Archived**: 2025-11-10
- **Reason**: Replaced by `extract_all_gliner.py`
- **Issue**: Used Llama 3.3 70B via Groq API, hit rate limits (100K tokens/day)
- **Replacement**: GLiNER + spaCy approach (local, zero API costs, faster)

## Why Archived?

These files represent earlier approaches that were replaced with better solutions during development. They're kept for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding architectural decisions
- Potential future use if requirements change
